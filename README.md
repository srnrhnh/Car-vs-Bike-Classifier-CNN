    <h1><b>Car vs Bike Classifier</b></h1>
</div>

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify vehicle images into two categories: cars and bikes. It aims to support Traffic and Road Safety Management Authorities by providing an automated classification system to enhance decision-making and operational efficiency.

## Data Sources üìä
- The dataset used in this project comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshsaxenadn/car-vs-bike-classification-dataset/data), containing labeled images of cars and bikes.

## Technologies Used ‚öôÔ∏è
- **Python** (data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation)
- **TensorFlow** and **Keras** (building the CNN model)
- **OpenCV** (image preprocessing)
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** (data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (model evaluation)

## Method üöÄ
- Data Preprocessing: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation
- Model Building: CNN architecture design and training
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Deployment: Saving the trained model for future use

## **Key Insights & Conclusions üß†**
1. **Classification Accuracy:**
   - The CNN model effectively classifies images into `car` or `bike` categories with high accuracy.
   - It demonstrates the importance of deep learning in identifying visual features.

2. **Application Potential:**
   - This model can be integrated into traffic monitoring systems to identify vehicle types automatically.
   - Useful for optimizing road safety strategies and traffic flow management.

3. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - Experiment with different CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet or EfficientNet) for potentially better performance.
   - Use a more diverse dataset and vehicle types to improve generalization for real-world scenarios.
